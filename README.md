## FAQ

### On macOS I get a dialog saying: "...canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."

You may need to explicitly open the driver one time in order to authorize its execution on your machine. You can do this by right-clicking on the binary file and selecting "Open" in the menu and then "Open" in the dialog that pops up. You can close the terminate the terminal that opens.

### I get an error saying: "selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version ..."

Ensure that your version of Chrome webdriver matches the version of the Chrome browser that you have installed on your machine.
